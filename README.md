# ðŸŒŒ Text Generation with Markov Chains  

A simple **text generation** project using **Markov Chains** that predicts the next word (or character) based on statistical patterns from a given dataset.  
The output style can be adapted for various creative needs â€” from storytelling to chatbots.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Markov Chains are a mathematical system that transition from one state to another based on certain probabilities.  
In this project, we:
- Train a Markov model on input text.
- Generate new sentences based on the learned probabilities.
- Support **word-level** or **character-level** generation.
